## Description

In this notebook, Iâ€™ll *recreate* a real time object detection app that is outlined in the tutorial: [How to implement a YOLO (v3) object detector from scratch in PyTorch, by Ayoosh Kathuria](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/).

## Tools & Dependencies

The project has been built using Python 3.x, Torch v.0.4.1 and Torchvision v.0.2.1. Detail list of required libraries can be found in the `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

To run this project:
  
1. With python 3.x installed, create a virtual environment and activate it as shown:
  
```shell
  virtualenv -p python3 my_virtualenv
  source my_virtualenv/bin/activate
```
2. Clone this repository into your virtual environment:  

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DL--YOLO-Real-Time-Object-Detection.git
```
3. Install project dependencies:  

```shell
pip install -r DL--YOLO-Real-Time-Object-Detection/requirements.txt
```
